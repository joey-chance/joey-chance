### Hi, I'm Joey!

I'm a maniac who loves to code in C++. If it makes it any better, I love parallel computing too :-).\
I'm an aspiring C++ developer who will be graduating from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a degree in Computer Science in May this year!\
Currently, I am interested in building trading systems or financial analyzers so that's where you'll see most of my activity on.
